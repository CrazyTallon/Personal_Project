Personal Project for my 3rd year of Comp Sci at the University of Southampton

Note - to add Nodes you must hold shift + right click, this was due to the library I used for the nodes and resizeable pane consuming events when it was unnessary,
making it impossible to add standard context menu request to it as a whole. 

May fix this at a later point in time as a seperate project as I would like to rewrite the code for the Node to Node section without the external library for more fluid code.

External Libraries used:
fxgraph
